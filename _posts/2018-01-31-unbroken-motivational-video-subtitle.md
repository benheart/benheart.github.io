### 英文字幕
You can only connect them looking backwards.

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

You have to trust in something:

your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

Because believing that the dots will connect down the road

will give you the confidence to follow your heart,

even when it lead you off the well worn path.

And that will make all the difference.

Your time is limited,

so don't waste it living someone else's life.

Don't be trapped by dogma:

which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

You've got to find what you love.

And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life

and the only way to be truly satisfied

is to do what you believe is great work.

And the only way to do great work...

is to love what you do.

If you haven't found it yet,

keep looking.

and don't settle.

Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition

They somehow already know

what you truly want to become.

You're going to have some ups and you're going to have some downs

Most people give up on themselves easily.

You know the human spirit is powerful?

There is nothing as powerful. It''s hard to kill the human spirit!

Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills are paid, they have happy relationships.

Anybody can be positive then,

Anybody can have a larger vision then,

anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.

The real challenge of growth

mentally, emotionally and spiritually

comes when you get knocked down.

It takes courage to act.

Part of being hungry when you have been defeated.

It takes courage...

to start over again.

Fear kills dreams.

Fear kills hope.

Fear...

Put people in the hospital.

Fear can age you.

Can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing,

but it will paralyze you.

At the end of your feelings is nothing,

but at the end of every principle is a promise.

Behind your little feelings, it might not be absolutely nothing at the end of your little feelings.

But behind every principle is a promise.

And some of you in your life

the reason why you not at your goal right now, 'cause you just all about your feelings.

All on your feelings, you don't feel like waking up,– so who does?

Everyday you say 'no' to your dreams,

you might be pushing your dreams back a whole six months, a whole year!

That one single day, that one day you didn't get up could have pushed your stuff back, I don''t know how long.

Don't allow your emotions to control you.

We are emotional, but what you want to begin to discipline your emotion

If you don't discipline and contain your emotion, they will use you.

You want it

and you're going to go all out to have it.

It''s not going to be easy, when you want to change, it''s not easy.

If it were in fact easy, everybody would do it.

But if you're serious, you''ll go all out.

I'm in control here.

I''m not going to let this get me down, I''m not going to let this destroy me.

I'm coming back!

And I'll be stronger and better because of it!

You have got to make a declaration

That this is what you stand for!

You're standing up for your dreams, you're standing up for peace of my, you're standing up for health.

Take full responsibility for your life.

Accept where you are and the responsibility that you're going to take yourself where you want to go.

You can decide that I am going to live each day as if it were my last!

Live your life with passion!

With some drive.

Decided that you are going to push yourself.

The last chapter to your life has not been written yet,

and it doesn't matter about what happened yesterday.

It doesn't matter about what happened to you, what matter is: ‘what are you going to do about it?'

This year I will make this goal become a reality.

I won't talk about it anymore.

I can.

I can!

I CAN!

To persevere I think is important for everybody.

Don't give up, don't give in.

There's always an answer to everything.

### 中文字幕
你无法预知未来将会发生什么

你只能回首过去的点滴

所以，要相信那些贯穿始终的信念

你不得不相信

你的勇气、生活、因果等等

相信这些会伴随你度过一生

它们会给你遵从自己真实想法的信心

甚至让你摆脱平凡

与众不同

你的时间并不是很充裕

不要无故把它浪费到别人的生活里

不要被教条束缚

活在别人为你规划的人生里

不要让别人的观点掩盖自己的真实想法

这样，你会找到你热爱的一切

不仅你的事业，还有你的伴侣

你的工作将占据大半个人生

唯一能使自己满足的方法

就是完成自己认为的非凡事业

唯一能成就非凡的方法

就是热爱自己的事业

如果你还没找到

继续寻找

不要安逸下来

大胆地听从内心呼唤和直觉指引

它们已经知道

你到底想怎样的人

人生起起伏伏

大部分人轻易地放弃了

你知道意志到底有多强大吗？

没有比意志更强大的东西,人类的意志坚不可摧

任何人都会感觉良好,不管是他们拥有健康、高薪、或是活络的人际关系

任何人都何以在这种情况下积极异常

任何人都可以在这种情况下拥有远见卓识

任何人都可以拥有这种环境下产生的信念

真正的挑战将扩大到心理、情绪、精神

将会在你倒下时接踵而至

拥有勇气才能反击

要无惧失败

只有拥有非凡的勇气

才能破旧立新

恐惧扼杀梦想

恐惧破灭希望

恐惧……

会使你变的脆弱

恐惧会沧桑你的内心

会束缚你的手脚，摧毁你的意志

并且使你一蹶不振

你消极的感受没有任何用处

但是每一个坚守都是对自己的承诺

体味乏味的情感之后，你几乎得不到任何有价值的东西

但是每个坚守后面都是一个可以实现的承诺

你们的一些人在生活中

没有达到目标的原因

就是你们太过情绪化了

你总是在意感受，不愿醒来

那么，谁又会关心呢？

每一天你都对你的梦想说“不”

你可能把你的梦想向后退后半年，甚至一年

每一天，你不愿意醒来，你的梦想就被向后推迟不知道多久

不要让情感左右了你

我们的确情绪化

但是，我们要控制情绪

如果你不控制和包容你的情绪

它们会吞噬你

如果你想

那就全力以赴

这也许不太容易，当你想要改变

这的确非常困难，如果真的很简单，人人都可以做到

如果你是认真地，那么你必定会全力以赴

我要掌控一切

我不想一蹶不振

我不想心如死灰

我终将归来

因而我必将更加强大和优秀

你必须下定决心

这就是你代表的 一切

你代表了你的梦想

你代表了你的思想

你代表了你的健康

勇敢地承担起生活的所有责任

接受目前的处境

下定付出到达目的地的代价的决心

你可以将每一天当做生命的最后一天

用激情来点燃你的生活

积极地面对一切

下定决心不断鞭策自己

人生最后一章还没有写下

不要管昨天发生了什么（昨日之事不可留）

也不要管现在发生了什么（今日之事莫烦忧），重要的是

你怎么去抗争（一定要去抗争）

今年我一定要实现目标

已经没有时间让我在这里废话

我能！

我能！

我能！

留志后来人

不要放弃，不要屈服

万事皆有答案
